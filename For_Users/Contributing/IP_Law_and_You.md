#Intellectual Property Rights and You

##The purpose of this document is to layout an understanding for how non-Zatobo related media should be handled by Zatobo collaborators.

First, this is not legal advice, this has not been reviewed by a lawyer and is not intended in any way to represent a legal discussion or replace legal counsel.  Instead it is a simplified way to deal with non-Zatobo media that should ensure that projects are not in violation of copyright law.


###Fair Use:
[See the wikipedia article here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use). For the purposes of Zatobo this is fairly simple.  You can use links to copyrighted works and use these links in your project as placeholders for non-copyrighted works to be added or created later or to be used as a guide for the creation of content. You **CANNOT** copy copyrighted works to a Zatobo repository.  This includes fragments of copyright works (e.g. a ten second sample of a song).  The only exception is if the copyright holder(s) have given you written permission to use their work in a public venue.  In this case, please post the written permission which should note the project name or other information and identify the project creator.  This should go into the licensing folder of your repository.  Please note, you must have permission from all rights holders not just one.  This can be an exceedingly difficult and arduous task.

If there is a question of copyright infringement and Zatobo receives a complaint we will err on the side of caution and remove potentially infringing material.

###Best Practices
Both Markdown (the syntax used to create this and other documents on Zatobo) and EPUB3 are closely related to HTML5 and support any number of in-line and embedded links to a variety of media files and these should be used to link to non Zatobo media.
